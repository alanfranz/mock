Mock creates chroots and builds packages in them. Its only task is to reliably populate a chroot and attempt to build a package in that chroot.

Prerequisites:

you need python rpm binding and rpmUtils (usually included in the yum package) 
in order to work with this software. Those are not included in the python 
setup since such bindings are usually strictly system related, and their
distributions aren't available on pypi.
